***Co-supervision with Deborah Giaschi***

I am a PhD student in the Psychology Department. I research how people use vision to guide attention and action. I am working on projects regarding attention and sensorimotor deficits in people with amblyopia. Outside the lab, I enjoy travelling and nature photography.
