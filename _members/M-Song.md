I am interested in neurorehabilitation, especially learning and brain plasticity. My research background is based on mechanical engineering, robotics, and rehabilitation engineering. After entering the field of neurorehabilitation, I conducted research using electroencephalogram (EEG), including brain computer interface (BCI), assessment of severity of neurological disorder using brain signal, and source-localized time-frequency analysis of brain signals. I have worked with various patients including: people with stroke, amputation, paralysis and cerebral palsy. My interest in neurorehabilitation has grown to interests in neuroscience mechanism of motor learning and brain plasticity. My current research is based on visuomotor behavior and its brain signal analysis using magnetoencephalogram (MEG). My studies will lead to finding efficient ways for neurorehabilitation, especially on the re-learning process of motor functions with disorder.
