  <p data-search="AbstractReading the prevailing emotion of groups of people   crowd emotion   is critical to understanding their overall intention and disposition  It alerts us to potential dangers  such as angry mobs or panicked crowds  giving us time to escape  A critical aspect of processing crowd emotion is that it must occur rapidly  because delays often are costly  Although knowing the timing of neural events is crucial for understanding how the brain guides behaviors using coherent signals from a glimpse of multiple faces  this information is currently lacking in the literature on face ensemble coding  Therefore  we used magnetoencephalography to examine the neurodynamics in the dorsal and ventral visual streams and the periamygdaloid cortex to compare perception of groups of faces versus individual faces  Forty six participants compared two groups of four faces or two individual faces with varying emotional expressions and chose which group or individual they would avoid  We found that the dorsal stream was activated as early as 68 msec after the onset of stimuli containing groups of faces  In contrast  the ventral stream was activated later and predominantly for individual face stimuli  The latencies of the dorsal stream activation peaks correlated with participants  response times for facial crowds  We also found enhanced connectivity earlier between the periamygdaloid cortex and the dorsal stream regions for crowd emotion perception  Our findings suggest that ensemble coding of facial crowds proceeds rapidly and in parallel by engaging the dorsal stream to mediate adaptive social behaviors  via a distinct route from single face perception Im  H Y   Cushing  C   Ward  N    amp  Kveraga  K   2021   Differential neurodynamics and connectivity in the dorsal and ventral visual pathways during perception of emotional crowds and individuals  a MEG study  Cognitive  Affective  and Behavioral Neuroscience   PDF ">

  <p data-search="AbstractIncreasing numbers of studies have explored human observers  ability to rapidly extract statistical descriptions from collections of similar items  e g   the average size and orientation of a group of tilted Gabor patches   Determining whether these descriptions are generated by mechanisms that are independent from object based sampling procedures requires that we investigate how internal noise  external noise  and sampling affect subjects  performance  Here we systematically manipulated the external variability of ensembles and used variance summation modeling to estimate both the internal noise and the number of samples that affected the representation of ensemble average size  The results suggest that humans sample many more than one or two items from an array when forming an estimate of the average size  and that the internal noise that affects ensemble processing is lower than the noise that affects the processing of single objects  These results are discussed in light of other recent modeling efforts and suggest that ensemble processing of average size relies on a mechanism that is distinct from segmenting individual items  This ensemble process may be more similar to texture processing Im  H Y    amp  Halberda  J   2013   The effects of sampling and internal noise on the representation of ensemble average size  Attention  Perception   amp  Psychophysics  75  278 286   PDF ">

  <p data-search="This study was published in Korean  Hangul  under the Korean Journal of Cognitive Science  Volume 18  The abstract has been translated here for convenience  AbstractThis study verified the effects of bottom up and top down information on blind spot filling through two psychophysical experiments  In both experiments  two stimuli with the same probability of filling the blind spot were presented to the blind spot  When these two stimuli compete to fill the blind spot  the depth context of one of the stimuli was manipulated to examine the interaction between upward and downward factors  Depth context was defined as the relative depth between the stimuli filled in the blind spot and the stimuli around the blind spot  and participants reported the perceptual depth of the target filled in the blind spot  As a result of the experiment  it was found that the blind spots were mostly filled with stimuli with added depth context  which is top down information  rather than stimuli with only bottom up information  Through controlled experiments  it was found that this depth perception was not due to the resolution of peripheral vision where the blind spot was located  The above experimental results suggest that the top down processing process  such as depth context information  also affects the blind spot filling process Park  K M   Cha  O   Kim  S   Im  H Y   Chong  S C    2007   The Influence of Depth Context on Blind Spot Filling in  Korean Journal of Cognitive Science  18  351 370 ">
