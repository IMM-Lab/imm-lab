<p>Attention networks are loosely defined as the regions of the brain which interact to control behaviour during attentional tasks, but the specific definition of attention networks varies between research programs based on task demands and modalities. The Attention Network Task was designed to exemplify three aspects of attention, alerting, orienting, and executive control, using a visual cueing paradigm. Its proponents propose a system of networks which underlies these aspects. It is debated whether there exists a unified system of networks which underlies attention independently of other cognitive and sensory processing systems. We review the evidence for an attention system within the domain of visual attention. Neuroimaging research using fMRI, EEG, MEG, and others across a variety of tasks attributed to attention, visual cueing, visual search, and divided attention, is compared. This concludes with a discussion on the limitations of an independent “attention system” for describing how the brain flexibly controls many abilities attributed to visual attention.

<p>Face ensemble coding is the perceptual ability to create a quick and overall impression of a group of faces, triggering social and behavioral motivations towards other people 
(approaching friendly people or avoiding an angry mob). Cultural differences in this ability have been reported, such that Easterners are better at face ensemble coding than 
Westerners are. The underlying mechanism has been attributed to differences in processing styles, with Easterners allocating attention globally, and Westerners focusing on local 
parts. However, the remaining question is how such default attention mode is influenced by salient information during ensemble perception. We created visual displays that 
resembled a real-world social setting in which one individual in a crowd of different faces drew the viewer’s attention while the viewer judged the overall emotion of the crowd. 
In each trial, one face in the crowd was highlighted by a salient cue, capturing spatial attention before the participants viewed the entire group. American participants’ judgment 
of group emotion more strongly weighed the attended individual face than Korean participants, suggesting a greater influence of local information on global perception. Our results 
showed that different attentional modes between cultural groups modulate social-emotional processing underlying people’s perceptions and attributions.

<p>The present study investigated the effect of facial masks on people’s ability to perceive emotions in crowds. We presented faces with the bottom halves occluded by masks or full faces without occlusion. In two sequentially presented crowds, we varied the number of faces, emotional valence, and intensity of facial expressions, examining the impact of masks on the perception of crowd emotion. Participants reported which of the two crowds they would avoid based on the crowds’ average emotions. The participants’ ability to judge the average emotion of a crowd, especially a crowd expressing happiness, was impaired when the crowd wore masks. For faces covered by masks, crowd emotion judgments were more negatively biased than those without masks. However, participants could still distinguish the emotional intensities of a crowd wearing masks above chance. Additionally, participants responded more quickly to a crowd with more people without compromising accuracy, despite the perceptual challenges imposed by facial masks. Our results suggest that under ambiguous social situations in which individuals’ emotions are partially hidden by masks, a large group may provide stronger social cues than a small group, thereby promoting communication and regulating social behaviors.</p>

<p>One of the brain’s primary functions is to promote actions in dynamic, distracting environments. Because distractions divert attention from our primary goals, we must learn to maintain accurate actions under sensory and cognitive distractions. Visuomotor adaptation is a learning process that restores performance when sensorimotor capacities or environmental conditions are abruptly or gradually altered. Prior work showed that learning to counteract an abrupt perturbation under a particular single- or dual-task setting (i.e., attentional context) was associated with better recall under the same conditions. This suggested that the attentional context was encoded during adaptation and used as a recall cue. The current study investigated whether the attentional context (i.e., single vs. dual task) also affected adaptation and recall to a gradual perturbation, which limited awareness of movement errors. During adaptation, participants moved a cursor to a target while learning to counteract a visuomotor rotation that increased from 0 to 45 by 0.3 each trial, with or without performing a secondary task. Relearning was impaired when the attentional context was different between adaptation and recall (experiment 1), even when the exposure to the attentional context was limited to the early or late half of adaptation (experiment 2). Changing the secondary task did not affect relearning, indicating that the attentional context, rather than specific stimuli or tasks, was associated with better recall performance (experiment 3). These findings highlight the importance of cognitive factors, such as attention, in visuomotor adaptation and have implications for learning and rehabilitation paradigms.</p>

<p><strong><em>NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY</em></strong> Adaptation acquired under single- or dual-task setting, which created an undivided or divided attentional
context, respectively, was impaired when relearning occurred under different conditions (i.e., shifting from a dual to single task).
Changes to the attentional context impaired relearning when the initial adaptation was to a gradual perturbation. Explicit awareness of the perturbation was not necessary for this effect to be robust, nor was the effect attributable to changes in the secondary task requirements.</p>

<p>Reading the prevailing emotion of groups of people (“crowd emotion”) is critical to understanding their overall intention and disposition. It alerts us to potential dangers, such as angry mobs or panicked crowds, giving us time to escape. A critical aspect of processing crowd emotion is that it must occur rapidly, because delays often are costly. Although knowing the timing of neural events is crucial for understanding how the brain guides behaviors using coherent signals from a glimpse of multiple faces, this information is currently lacking in the literature on face ensemble coding. Therefore, we used magnetoencephalography to examine the neurodynamics in the dorsal and ventral visual streams and the periamygdaloid cortex to compare perception of groups of faces versus individual faces. Forty-six participants compared two groups of four faces or two individual faces with varying emotional expressions and chose which group or individual they would avoid. We found that the dorsal stream was activated as early as 68 msec after the onset of stimuli containing groups of faces. In contrast, the ventral stream was activated later and predominantly for individual face stimuli. The latencies of the dorsal stream activation peaks correlated with participants’ response times for facial crowds. We also found enhanced connectivity earlier between the periamygdaloid cortex and the dorsal stream regions for crowd emotion perception. Our findings suggest that ensemble coding of facial crowds proceeds rapidly and in parallel by engaging the dorsal stream to mediate adaptive social behaviors, via a distinct route from single face perception.

<p>Ensemble representations are often described as efficient tools when summarizing features of multiple similar objects as a group. However, it can sometimes be more useful not to compute a single summary description for all of the objects if they are substantially different, for example when they belong to entirely different categories. It was proposed that the visual system can efficiently use the distributional information of ensembles to decide whether simultaneously displayed items belong to single or several different categories. Here we directly tested how the feature distribution of items in a visual array affects an ability to discriminate individual items (Experiment 1) and sets (Experiments 2–3) when participants were instructed explicitly to categorize individual objects based on the median of size distribution. We varied the width (narrow or fat) as well as the shape (smooth or two-peaked) of distributions in order to manipulate the ease of ensemble extraction from the items. We found that observers unintentionally relied on the grand mean as a natural categorical boundary and that their categorization accuracy increased as a function of the size differences among individual items and a function of their separation from the grand mean. For ensembles drawn from two-peaked size distributions, participants showed better categorization performance. They were more accurate at judging within-category ensemble properties in other dimensions (centroid and orientation) and less biased by superset statistics. This finding corroborates the idea that the two-peaked feature distributions support the “segmentability” of spatially intermixed sets of objects. Our results emphasize important roles of ensemble statistics (mean, range, distribution shape) in explicit visual categorization.

<p>The parallel pathways of the human visual system differ in their tuning to luminance, color, and spatial frequency. These attunements recently have been shown to propagate to differential processing of higher-order stimuli, facial threat cues, in the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) pathways, with greater sensitivity to clear and ambiguous threat, respectively. The role of the third, koniocellular (K) pathway in facial threat processing, however, remains unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we briefly presented peripheral face stimuli psychophysically biased towards M, P, or K pathways. Observers were instructed to report via a key-press whether the face was angry or neutral while their eye movements and manual responses were recorded. We found that short-latency saccades were made more frequently to faces presented in the K channel than to P or M channels. Saccade latencies were not significantly modulated by expressive and identity cues. In contrast, manual response latencies and accuracy were modulated by both pathway biasing and by interactions of facial expression with facial masculinity, such that angry male faces elicited the fastest, and angry female faces, the least accurate, responses. We conclude that face stimuli can evoke fast saccadic and manual responses when projected to the K pathway.
